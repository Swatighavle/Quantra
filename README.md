(section 1 - quantra.zip file)
```bash
Use of this project is to automate the given end 2 end scenario for Quantinsti website. I have used :-
Page Object Model design pattern for this assignment where I have created separate class for each page and a separate class for test-case.
I have another common class BaseClass.java for starting and closing the browser instance. To manage the dependency and order of execution between the classes I have used testNG. However, due to the time constraint I couldnt able to use testng.xml and all other possible classes which could make this project more efficient ( like creating separate for supporting methods and directly inherit them in pages).
